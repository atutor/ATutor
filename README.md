## About 

ATutor is a learning management system to continue professional development for teachers, career developers, and academic research. It is written in PHP in a cross platform operating system.

## Features
Two accessibility features in the system are text alternatives for all visual elements and keyboard access to all elements of the program. With these features, a blind person can listen to the entire interface of the system with the help of a screen reader, and he or she can access the system without needing a mouse. These features also allow ATutor to adapt to a wide variety of technologies including cell phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), and text-based Web browsers, to name a few. ATutor is also designed for adaptability to any of several teaching and learning scenarios. There are four main areas that reflect this design principle: themes, privileges, tool modules, and groups
