<h2>Themes</h2>
	<p>Themes are used for changing the look and feel of an ATutor installation. Themes can be set as a personal preference or forced to display by default using the <a href="system_preferences.php">System Preferences</a> <em>Theme Specific Categories</em> option.</p>

	<p>ATutor's architecture allows for the separation of presentation elements from code or logic elements. As a result, it is easy for any <acronym title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, the web's structured language">XHTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets, the web's presentation layer">CSS</acronym> proficient person to create customized themes and layouts without having to know anything about <acronym title="Recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, the language ATutor is written in">PHP</acronym> or the inner workings of ATutor itself.</p>
