<h2>Course Categories</h2>
	<p>Categories are used for grouping related courses. This is helpful when viewing courses in the course browser. Courses can be associated with categories when they are created, or at a later time by editing their properties. Course categories can also be associated with Themes if the <a href="system_preferences.php">System Preferences</a> <em>Theme Specific Categories</em> option is enabled.</p>
