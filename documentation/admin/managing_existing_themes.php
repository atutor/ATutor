	<h3>Category Themes</h3>
	<p>If there are <a href="categories.php">Course Categories</a> defined and the <a href="system_preferences.php">System Preferences</a> <em>Theme Specific Categories</em>  has been enabled, themes can be assigned to categories of courses so they are all displayed with the same look and feel. When defining course categories while Category Themes is enabled, a list of available themes will appear to select from, and assign to each category.</p>

	<p>Note that when Category Themes has been enabled, users will no longer be able to select themes from their personal preference settings.</p>
