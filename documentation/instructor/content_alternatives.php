<h2>Adapted Content</h2>
<p>Based on the IMS AccessForAll and ISO 24751 standards, the Adapted Content utility allows authors to enhance their content with alternative formats.  Alternative formats can be used to replace or supplement content for people with disabilities who may not be able to access the original version, or it can be used to supplement the original content by including the same content in multi-modal forms, allowing learners to experience the content through multiple senses.</p>
		
<h3>Define Alternatives for Original Content</h3>
<p>Down the left of the Adapted Content screen is displayed a list of files found in the original content, such as audio files, videos, images, documents etc. for which adapted forms can be defined. To the right alternatives can be defined. </p>

<dl>
    <dt>Original Resources</dt>
    <dd>Along the left side of the Adapted Content panel in the content editor will appear a list of files linked into the original content, referred to as <strong>Original Resources</strong>. For each, define the Resource Type  by selecting the appropriate check box(es) (Auditory, Textual, or Visual). To add an alternate format for a particular original resource, click the Add buttons next to each listed resource, then press the <strong>Use As Alternative</strong> button next to available files in the popup File Manager to associate the file as an alternative resource.</dd>

    <dd>To remove an adapted resource, click the <strong>Delete</strong> icon next to the filename of the adapted resource. This removes the association between the original and alternative resources, but does not delete the actual files. Click on the <strong>Alter</strong> icon next to an alternative to make changes. Click on a filename to preview a resource. </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remote Content</h3>
<p>It is also possible to use remote content, such as YouTube videos, and to associate either local content, present in the course's File Manager, or remote content, such as another YouTube video, as alternatives. Local and remote content can be mixed, such as a local original resource, and remote alternatives, or visa versa.</p>
<!--h3>Define Alternatives to Text Content</h3>
<p>Selecting this option at the top of the Alternate Content screen will open an editor much like the primary content editor. It can be used to create a complete alternate content page that replaces the original Primary Content when viewed by users who have set their preferences to display alternatives to text content. This editor might be used to create a media rich alternative for a plain text primary content page. Define the the resource types, or the alternative forms found in the page. </p -->
