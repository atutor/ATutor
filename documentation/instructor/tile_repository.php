<h2>AContent Repository</h2>
	<p>Content created in ATutor can be exported to the <em> AContent Repository</em> using the <em>Export</em> tool on the Import/Export Content screen. Content can also be imported from the AContent repository by entering a search term into the <em>AContent Search</em>, then using <em>Import</em> feature next to a listing in the search results.  Click on a content's title to <em>Preview</em> the content in AContent, or use <em>Download</em> to retrieve the content package from the AContent repository. Once downloaded, the retrieved package can be imported into ATutor using the Import/Export Content import tool, or imported into another system that supports the IMS Content Packaging standard. AContent can also be added to a course as a course tool, that students can use to search the repository for information.</p>
