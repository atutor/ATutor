<h2>Glossary</h2>
	<p>The Glossary lists all course terms, their definitions and related terms. Terms can be added to the glossary by using the <em>Add Glossary Term</em> link in the Glossary Manager, or by adding terms directly into content while it is being created using the <a href="content.php">Content Editor</a>.</p>

	<p>The Glossary is a <a href="student_tools.php">Course Tool</a> and can therefore be enabled or disabled, linked from the main menu, linked from the home page, or displayed as a module in the side menu.</p>
