<h2>Test Submissions</h2>
	<p>To view the submissions of a test, choose a test from the Test/Survey Manager and use the <code>Submissions</code> button.  The list of student submissions will be listed, and can be filtered to show all, marked or unmarked tests.</p>
	
	<p>Unmarked tests are those requiring instructor input, or those with open-ended questions. Multiple-choice and true-false questions are automatically marked by the Atutor system and Likert questions do not require marking.</p>
	
	<p>To view and/or mark test submissions, choose a submission from the list and use the <kbd>View &amp; Mark Test</kbd> button. The test will be displayed with a box beside each question for entering or editing the mark.  Multiple-choice and true-false answers show a red "X" icon beside an answer if the student answered incorrectly, or a green checkmark if he/she was right.  If an answer is incorrect, the correct answer will be shown with a green checkmark after it in brackets. Use <code>Save</code> to enter the marks into the system and return to the submission manager.</p>
