<h2>Content</h2>
	<p>Content in ATutor can be managed in many ways and can be imported and created from many different sources. Content can be entered manually, created from HTML files, standards compliant content packages, or from a learning objects content repository. Content that already exists in ATutor can also be exported into any of the mentioned formats. Only instructors, and assistants who are given content <a href="enrollment_privileges.php">privileges</a>, can manage course content.</p>

	<p>Existing content pages can be managed using the <em>Shortcuts</em> links available when viewing a content page, or through the Content section under the Manage tab.</p>
