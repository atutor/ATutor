<h2>Managing Files &amp; Folders</h2>

	<p>It is possible to <em>Rename</em>, <em>Delete</em>, and <em>Move</em> files and folders within the File Manager. Choose a file (or files if mass-deleting or moving to one location) from the File Manager list, then use the appropriate button for the action.</p>

	<p>Renaming a file will change the name of the file.</p>

	<p>Deleting a file deletes all selected files and folders from the ATutor system.  If a folder is being deleted, the files within it will also be deleted. Once the deletion is confirmed, the files can not be undeleted.</p>

	<p>To Move files to a different location, choose a new location from the File Manager tree and use the <code>Move</code> button.  Once the move is confirmed, all selected files will be found in the new directory.</p>
