<h2>My Network</h2>


<p>ATutor Social is a social networking environment that allows ATutor users to develop a network of contacts,  create and participate in social groups,  and develop a social profile. It is based on the Google Open Social Standard.  Many Open Social applications, or <a href="my_gadgets.php">gadgets</a> as they are called, are available around the Internet and can be linked into your social networking environment to customize it to your liking.</p>
