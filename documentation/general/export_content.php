<h2>Export Content</h2>

<p>The Export Content feature creates a "Content Package" that can be downloaded and viewed offline in the viewer included with each package. If  this feature is turned on for a course, it may be accessed through a Student Tool icon on the home page, and/or a link in the main navigation. Choose which section you wish to download as a content package the use the <code>Export</code> button. <em>Export Content</em> is also linked from top level content pages or all content pages (depending on what the instructor has set) in the Shortcuts box.  Using this link will package the current page and all of its sub pages into a single "zip" file, and prompt the user to download the file.</p>

<p>The downloaded file can be unpacked with a common archiving application (e.g. WinZip, PKZip, Unzip). Unzip the file into an empty directory then open the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file into a Web browser. </p>
