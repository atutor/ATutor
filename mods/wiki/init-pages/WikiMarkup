Each page inside a WikiWikiWeb can be edited easily, and as writing
a page should be very easy to accomplish, there are only a few
rules, which are not all that senseless and annoying as the ones of the
HyperTextMarkupLanguage.

Click on the [EditThisPage]Link at the bottom of this page or else
all you read here won't make much sense to you.


! Paragraphs

* separate paragraphs inside the text with empty lines
* use three percent signs %%''''% to enforce a line break
* if you prepend text with spaces or tabs it will get indented


! !! Headlines

* use an exclamation mark ! at the beginning of a line to create a small headline
* !! for medium
* !!! for large headlines


! text style

* if you want to ''emphasize text'' enclose it in two single-quotes '' (usually looks italic)
* __text gets bold__ with two underscores __ (or if enclosed with two asterisks **)
* to make ##text big## enclose it in hash characters ##
* you can get µµ smaller text µµ using "µµ" likewise
* a ==typewrite like font== will be used if you enclose text in two equal == signs


! Lists

* start a line with an asterisk * to begin a list
* use # instead for numerated lists
*# you can create sublists
*# subsequent list points should start with the same mix of * and #


! !HyperLinks

* just enter a WikiWord inside your text to create a new HyperLink
* enclose some [words in square brackets] to create a !HyperLink inside the WikiWikiWeb which is not made up of a valid WikiWord
* any valid internet address (starting with [http://]) like http://www.example.com/ inside the text will be made clickable automagically
* enclose a www address or a !WikiLink inside square brackets [[freshmeat | http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/ewiki]] and assign it a neat title using quotation marks or the | character
** ![title | http://example.com]
** ![WikiWord "title"] or !["title for" WikiLink]
* if you don't want a !WikiWord or a !http://www-address (or ![anything] inside square brackets) to become a !HyperLink then just prepend it with a exclamation mark or a tilde
** !!NoHyperLink, ~~NoHyperLink
** !![no hyperlink], !!http://nolink.org/


! Tables with |

| just enclose | things with the dash | character |
| to build a | table structure  |
| browsers usually | leave out the missing | cells |

Please always put an empty line before and after a table, so it stands out from other text in its own paragraph.


! Pictures

* to include an image into a page enclose its absolute www-address in square brackets, like ![[http://www.example.com/pics/image.png]]
* alternatively you could use the ImageUploading function, see EditThisPage
