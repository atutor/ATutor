    <description lang="en">The Gradebook allows instructors to automatically gather scores from tests and quizzes taken through the ATutor Test Manager, and allows them to define external tests or assignments and manually record marks for those. It will allow students to view their marks for completed tests or assignments, list tests or assignments yet to be completed or yet to be marked, and print out a report of their marks.</description>
