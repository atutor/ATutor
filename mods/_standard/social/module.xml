	<notes>ATutor Social runs with or without the OpenSocial Shindig server. You may point to your own Shindig server if you have one (download from: http://incubator.apache.org/shindig/), or use the ATutor social network server at http://social.atutor.ca/shindig/php. See the Administrator's Networking Admin panel to setup a link to a Shindig server, and link to other netowrks and applications, or do not use Shindig to create a self-contained social network using only your local ATutor installation.</notes>
