Authenticate Wordpress Users from ATutor Members
To remove the need to setup separate accounts in WordPress and ATutor, you can install the WordPress External DB  Authentication plugin. 

Plugin details can be found at:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/external-database-authentication/

Note that this is not a single sign-on, but rather just a way to ensure anyone registered in ATutor, is automatically registered in Wordpress. When a users logs into Wordpress for the first time, the member information in ATutor is copied over to WordPress. If you find you are unable to login with an account you know esits in ATutor, review the cookies you have set in your browser, and remove and WordPress related ones. Then try to login again.

Note also that you will probably want to install this Wordpress plugin before you start using Wordpress with ATutor. Otherwise you will need to recreate any Wordpress accounts in ATutor.
