            XSD Data File Information
            -------------------------
            Author:       Colin Smythe (IMS, UK)
            Date:         31st October, 2006
            Version:      2.0
            Status:       Public Draft
            Description:  This is a normative representation of the IMS Packaging Extension 1.0 Information Model for binding 
                          purposes.  Read the corresponding IMS Content Packaging Information Model for the Platform 
                          Independent Model representation.

            History:      Version 2 includes the modified definition of LingualTitle.
                          Version 1  of the IMS Packaging Utility v1.2 XSD for public draft release.
                          It has a target namespace of http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imscp_extensionv1p2.
                          This Utility uses this general approach to modeling:
                          (1) All of the elements and attributes are defined as local to their host object;
                          (2) There are multiple host objects;
                          (3) Comments have been added to the complexType definitions.

                        A variant element is closely analogous to a resource element in the 
                        IMS Content Packaging Information Model.  Variant is a container for a 
                        an alternative resource.  A resource may contain references 
                        to assets that are all of the same type or different types (i.e., file formats).
                        
                        The Variant class points to the alternatibe resource.  Metadata is used to 
                        describe the nature of a collection of alternative assets and their intended 
                        use.  Examples include, but are not limited to, use as lingual variants, 
                        visual or auditory variants, remediation variants, or platform delivery variants.
                        
                        The scope of referenced assets is specific to a Variant object.  Their use is in the
                        context of the parent object containing a variant instance, typically a bound instance
                        of a Resource object from the IMS CP namespace.
