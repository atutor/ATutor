         This file has been modified by the Knowledge Media Institute of the 
         University Koblenz-Landau (http://iwm.uni-koblenz.de). It contains the
         following changes:
         1) Instead of "unique/strict.xsd" the schema "unique/loose.xsd" is imported 
            because this reflects what is said in 1484.12.3-2005, page 35 (section C.1.3)
         2) In all component XSDs the schemaLocation attribute was amended to the 
            xs:import and xs:include statements. This enables the usage of the schemas
            with tools which don't deal well with missing schemaLocation informations.
