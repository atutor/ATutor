Welcome to PHPDoc!

PHPDoc is an attemt to adopt Javadoc to the PHP world. This version
is the first public beta version. I started coding a few monts ago but
was not really satisfied with the code so it took some time up to this day.

As said this is beta stuff. It's not perfect at all. Here's some known bugs:

- needs PHP4.03dev+
- variable warnings are thrown before information inheritance takes place
- @todo and @exclude do not work

This will change soon. 

PHPDoc is distributed under LGPL. That means you can use it even in 
commercial projects. 

Documentation will follow after the german php congress and after the weekend.

Have fun with it!
