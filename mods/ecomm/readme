How the module works
Payments are course fees associated with an enrollment in a Private course. When a student attempts to enroll in a private course that has a fee associated with it, an entry will be added to the student's Payments screen, accessed through a tab in MyStart page. If the student clicks on Make Payment, they are asked to fill in some personal information, confirm that information, then they are redirectled to the secure payment site, where they enter their visa or master card number (availability of either depending on the merchant account), and submit the payment. Just before being redirected to the secure site the information entered by the student is stored in the ec_shop table, and it is updated when the payment service has confirmed the payment. If the course has been set to auto-enroll students, they will immediately be given access to the course. If manual enrollment is set, they will recieve a notice of their pending enrolment, which the instructor, or administrator must approve. 


Administrators can manage individual course payments and settings by logging into a specific course, then managing the course payment settings as describe below for Instructors.

If instrutors are allowed to manage their payments, set by the administrator in step 6 above, they can access Payments through the Manage screen, where they can set the price for the course, and set whether to auto-enroll students, and whether to send an email to the instructor when a payment  has been received. These settings are saved in the ec_course_fees table.

To make a payment students must first click on Enter Course in the Browse Course listing, then choose to enroll in the course. Then under the Payments Tab, click on Make Payment next to the course that is pending enrollment.
