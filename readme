ATutor Readme

Installing an ATutor bundled distribution 
Full installation and upgrade instructions are available at:
http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/installation.php

Installing from a GitHub Clone
1. If you are installing ATutor from a GitHub clone, rather than an ATutor bundled distribution, follow the usual installation and upgrade instructions at the link above.
2. Before running the Installer, you will need to create an empty config file. To create the file, from the ATutor base directory, issue the command 
touch include/config.inc.php
3. Then follow the instruction given by the Installer.

GitHub Basics
If you wish to have code you've developed added to the ATutor public source code, you will need to understand a few Git basics.
