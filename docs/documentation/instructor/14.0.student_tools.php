<h2>14. Student Tools</h2>
	<p>Student Tools is a collection of course features that may be useful for various types of learning activities. Tools include: Forums, Glossary, Site-map, Links, Polls, TILE Repository Search, Tests &amp; Surveys, My Tracker, Export Content, Chat, Directory, Inbox, and Packages. Instructors can decide where these tools will be accessed from - the <em>Main Navigation</em>, and/or <em>Course Home</em>.</p>

	<dl>
	<dt>Main Navigation</dt>
	<dd>In the default Atutor theme, the Main Navigation appears as tabs below the title of the course. Student Tools specified to appear here will each have their own tab. Note that other themes may choose to display the Main Navigation differently. </dd>

	<dt>Course Home</dt>
	<dd>Course Home is the first page viewed when a student enters a course. Student Tools that are selected to appear on the Home page will be displayed with an icon and a label above the course announcements.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>If neither <em>Main Navigation</em> or <em>Course Home</em> options are selected, then that Student Tool be "turned off", or not accessible to students. An instructor might choose to turn on Student Tools as they are needed, for example turning on the Tests &amp; Surveys tool when a test is available, or turning on the Chat when an online meeting is going to take place.</p>

	<p>Using the arrows in the <em>Order</em> column will change the ordering of the student tool as it appears in the <em>Main Navigation</em> and on the <em>Course Home</em> page.</p>
