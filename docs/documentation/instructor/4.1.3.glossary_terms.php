<h2>4.1.3 Glossary Terms</h2>
<p>If you specified Terms in the Content tab, you have the opportunity to define those terms under the Glossary tab of the Content Editor. For each term specified in the <em>Content</em>, there is a Definition window where you can provide your definition or explanation. If there are no glossary terms listed, you can add glossary terms by going to the Content tab and adding Term tags (<kbd>[?] [/?]</kbd>). </p> 
	
	<p>It is also possible to associate related terms in the glossary. Links to those terms will appear along with glossary items. </p>
