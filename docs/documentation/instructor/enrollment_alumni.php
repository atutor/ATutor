<h2>Alumni</h2>

<p>Instructors can mark students who have completed the course as alumni. Alumni have access to all course content with the exception of tests and surveys. They can particpate in activities to help new students master the content of the course, such as contributing to the forums. Select students from the <em>Enrolled</em> list,  then use <code>Mark Alumni</code> to add the students to the <em>Alumni</em> list.  Re-enrolling or removing alumni can be done from the Alumni tab.</p>
