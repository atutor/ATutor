<h2>15.3 Question Categories</h2>
	<p>Question categories are useful for organizing questions, but also make it easier to add questions into tests.  When adding questions, it is possible to simply check the box beside the category name which will add all of the questions within it, instead of having to check each question separately. Use the <em>Create Category</em> link to create a category.  It will then appear in the Question Categories manager where it can be Edited and Deleted.</p>
