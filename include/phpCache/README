phpCache v1.4 by nathan@0x00.org

NOTICE: I would like to hear success stories, please email me with any
		timing results or whatever.  Before and after, duh.

This is a little caching system for PHP, it allows you to cache blocks of
code on pages.  There are four functions you need to worry about, all
sorta documented in phpCache.inc.

These are the basic functions (please see phpCache.inc for the rest):

cache_all($cache_time);
// Caches the block of code that follows scoped to everyone
cache_session($cache_time);
// Caches the block of code that follows scoped to the session

cache($cache_time, $object_name, $object_key);
// This is the primary function, both cache_all() and cache_session() call
	this.  It allows you to tweak to storage settings so you can scope it
	to different things.  If you don't understand this, don't use it.

endcache($store);
// This function *MUST* be called after all the cached data has been output.
	It must be called in the block.  If $store is TRUE, the data will be
	cached.  If it is false, it will not be cached.

Note: All these functions (except endcache()) return 0 if the block needs to be executed.
	ie: the cache has expired.

Please see the scripts in the demo directory for samples.
